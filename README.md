"Native once-removed" mobile apps refer to apps that use web technologies (such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to create the user interface, but also have access to native functionality of the device (such as the camera or GPS) through a bridge. 

This allows for a more seamless experience for the user, as the app can access device features in a similar way as a native app, while still being developed and maintained as a web app. Examples of these types of apps include Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) and React Native apps.


Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) and React Native are both technologies for building mobile apps, but they have some key differences.

PWAs are web apps that use modern web technologies to create a user experience that is similar to a native app. PWAs can be accessed through a web browser and can be installed on a user's home screen, just like a native app. They also have offline capabilities, push notifications, and can access native device features through browser APIs. PWAs are typically easier to develop and maintain than native apps, as they use the same codebase for multiple platforms.

React Native, on the other hand, is a framework for building mobile apps using JavaScript and the React library. React Native allows developers to use the same codebase for both iOS and Android platforms. The apps built with React Native have a native-like performance and can access all the native device functionalities. The development process of React-Native is slightly complex than PWAs and requires developer to be familiar with the React library.

In summary, PWAs are web apps that can be installed on a user's home screen, while React Native is a framework for building mobile apps using JavaScript and React. PWAs are easier to develop and maintain, while React Native allows for a more native-like performance and access to all native device features.

### Progressive Web Apps vs Web Apps

Web mobile apps and Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are both types of mobile apps, but they have some key differences.

Web mobile apps, also known as mobile web apps, are apps that are accessed through a web browser on a mobile device. They are typically built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and are designed to be responsive to different screen sizes and resolutions. They can also be accessed on any device with a web browser, which makes them platform-independent. However, they may not have offline capabilities and may not have access to all of the device's features.

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), on the other hand, are web apps that are designed to provide a user experience that is similar to a native app. PWAs can be accessed through a web browser, but they can also be installed on a user's home screen and can be run offline. They can also access native device features through browser APIs and also have push notifications. PWAs are typically easier to develop and maintain than native apps, as they use the same codebase for multiple platforms.

In summary, web mobile apps are accessed through a web browser and are platform-independent, while PWAs are web apps that can be installed on a user's home screen, run offline, and have access to native device features. PWAs offer a more native-like experience and are easier to develop and maintain than native apps or web mobile apps.
